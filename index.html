            <p>We are lowkey, a group of young tunisians bonded together (united) to boost tourism in our beloved country.
                our vision is to make tunisia the most desirable place to go for tourists and the most memorable adventure to make
                for travelers. We hope this huge campaign we are organizing help change the image the world has of our country and make it an internationally recognized touristic spot.

            <p>The Tunisian art & culture has long been shaped by all sorts of outside influences. The Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, French and even the Americans have all had a big role in making our culture what it is today. This beautiful blend resulted in a mature and unique set of pillars that allow us Tunisians to enjoy art-forms ranging from good music and exquisite paintings to thought-provoking books and poems.</p>

            Tunisia is a mediterranean country untouched by mass tourism. It may be a small country in north Africa, but the vast amount of different landscapes and ancient history prime it as an exciting underrated experience. I like to imagine it as the traveler's paradise.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            During my trip to Tunisia I spent 3 days traveling across it. I started off my journey by spending a day in Tunis, the capital city. Throughout it's streets we can find various restaurants with all kinds of cuisines. I challenge you to find a restaurant called “Fondok al Attarin” in Al-Medina which serves what may be the best couscous I have ever had in my entire life. It serves all sorts of authentic Tunisian dishes, I also had a brika as they call it which is basically a fried wrap of a mixture of cheese and greens with a runny yolk in the middle. Food aside, souks in the Medina are a pleasure to walk through. I found different vendors of things ranging from jewelry to souvenirs, clothes and even some coffee made by the locals who live there. We also came across holy houses named after “awliya salhin” who are respected Tunisian figures and basically you can go to these houses to get their blessing.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">
            During my tour in downtown Tunis we came across different monuments of Tunisian architecture. Most notably, the Monguela as the natives call it. It is a tall clock tower situated in the middle of Bourguiba avenue. The Bourguiba avenue itself is the central point of Tunis and it houses so many different restaurants and coffee shops for tourists to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            Next up, Sidi Bousaid. This marvelous city of blue and white really piqued my interest. I had actually stayed there for the night since I found a really cheap yet beautiful Airbnb there. I tried their famous bambalouni which is almost like a sugary sweet fried donut. It is best eaten hot!
            Sidi Bousaid also offers some really beautiful views, especially a view of the mediterranian and some beautiful hills to hike in. If you want to see more beauty I suggest you visit the art galleries there!
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-right">
            The following day, I started my journey to Djerba. I made a few stops on the way there. First of all, I hiked through the outskirts of Takrouna, such a beautiful village full of Tunisian heritage and delicious food. Luckily for me I had lunch with a family there, they were very welcoming of me!
            Secondly, I spent quite some time in Kairouan which is famous for Okba ibn-Nafaa’s mosque. He was the one who brought the Islamic religion to north Africa. This mosque is also a part of UNESCO’s world heritage. I strolled around the souks and alleyways of downtown Kairouan and I saw a lot of beautiful mural art and exquisite handmade traditional rugs and clothes for sale. I obviously enjoyed the famous Kairouan food, most notably their Kafteji, even though it’s VERY spicy, I definitely enjoyed it! I also had their unique honey dipped “cookies” called makroudh. I’m definitely visiting Kairouan again on the way back to Tunis!
            Since I’m a big fan of StarWars and a big portion of the very first part was filmed in Touzer I decided to visit their famous set. I really loved how their hotels were influenced by the StarWars-esque architecture. Their oasis is equally as beautiful, so inviting and full of life.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            Finally, I made it to Djerba, the island of dreams. If you’re looking for a place that sums up living on an island, Djerba is the place to go. Just 5 km of Tunisia’s southern coast, this peninsula’s gently sloping sandy beaches and perfect climate has made it a popular stop for travelers.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">
            When I arrived there, it was exciting to sleep in a traditional Tunisian “houch” to know more about the real Tunisian life, passing the night in there is an amazing experience. 
            Mostly part of a shared house, these cave-like rooms are comfortable, charming, and typically Djerbian. They make you feel peaceful and rested immediately. You will find these houses mostly in the countryside just outside of the main city, surrounded by orchards, olive trees and swaying palm trees. Right after I went to the old town area of Djerba’s main destination, Houmt Souk to buy some souvenirs. It is a quaint maze of alleyways lined by picture-esque whitewashed houses, and therefore is perfect for a beautiful day of strolling around, while buying loads of hand-painted pottery, traditional jewelry and carpets with colorful prints. The purple bougainvilleas growing on the houses’ white façades against the backdrop of a clear blue sky is an image you will never forget.
            Djerba is famous for its crystal clear beaches. It’s incredible to just enjoy the sun,get that tan you always wanted and go for a relaxing and refreshing swim in the incredibly turquoise waters surrounding the so-called ‘island of the thousand palm trees’. Djerba is a prime tourist destination for a reason!
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            I can't forget the oldest place is The El-Ghriba synagogue is a fine intermezzo when discovering the village of Er-Riadh, located in central Djerba. It is the most prominent reminder of the island’s vibrant Jewish community, who have lived in El-Riadh since 586BC, and is still an important place of pilgrimage for Jews from all over the world. Although not very impressive from the outside, El-Ghriba’s interior is a rich mix of blue tiles warmed by sunlight streaming in through colored glass windows. The Torah scrolls kept at this synagogue are among the most important and valuable in the world.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">
            I’d like to end on one note though, this is a tip for all of you. Bring some cash with you otherwise you’re gonna have some trouble getting around and enjoying the country. I had to use 5 ATMs just to withdraw the equivalent of 150 dollars… Don’t make the same mistake haha!
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            Seriously though, Tunisia is a perfect destination for those who are looking for something different than the usual go-to-a-hotel-then-go-back-home sort of vacation. I really really recommend you eat all the food you can get! Last but not least, enjoy your stay!
